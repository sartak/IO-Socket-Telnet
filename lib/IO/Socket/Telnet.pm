=head1 NAME

IO::Socket::Telnet - Transparent telnet negotiation for IO::Socket::INET

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01 released ???

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::Socket::Telnet;
    my $socket = IO::Socket::Telnet->new(PeerAddr => 'random.server.org',
                                         PeerPort => 23);
    while (1) {
        $socket->send(scalar <>);
        defined $socket->recv(my $x, 4096) or die $!;
        print $x;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Telnet is a simple protocol that sits on top of TCP/IP. It handles the
negotiation of various options, both about the connection itself (ECHO)
and the setup of both sides of the party (NAWS, TTYPE).

This is a wrapper around L<IO::Socket::INET> that both strips out the telnet
escape sequences and lets you handle the negotiation in a high-level manner.

There is currently no interface for defining callbacks. This will be rectified
very soon. The module as it stands is still useful for stripping out telnet
escape sequences.

This module is likely missing large parts of the telnet spec. Please let me
know if you need particular things implemented. Failing test cases are the
best bug reports!

=head1 CAVEATS

You must use the C<< $socket->recv(...) >> method call form.
C<recv($socket, ...)> will not invoke the necessary methods. You can use
C<print $socket ...> because C<print> currently has no special semantics.

=head1 SIMILAR MODULES

L<Net::Telnet> has a similar purpose, to interact via telnet with someone else.
The major difference is that L<Net::Telnet> tries to be L<Expect> to some
degree as well. This is fine if that's what you need to do, but the author of
L<IO::Socket::Telnet> wants to play NetHack on a remote server, and
L<Net::Telnet> doesn't help him very much.
