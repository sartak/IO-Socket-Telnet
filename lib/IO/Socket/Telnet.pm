=head1 NAME

IO::Socket::Telnet - transparent telnet negotiation for IO::Socket::INET

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.02 released 04 Nov 07

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.02';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::Socket::Telnet;
    my $socket = IO::Socket::Telnet->new(PeerAddr => 'random.server.org');
    while (1) {
        $socket->send(scalar <>);
        defined $socket->recv(my $x, 4096) or die $!;
        print $x;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Telnet is a simple protocol that sits on top of TCP/IP. It handles the
negotiation of various options, both about the connection itself (ECHO)
and the setup of both sides of the party (NAWS, TTYPE).

This is a wrapper around L<IO::Socket::INET> that both strips out the telnet
escape sequences and lets you handle the negotiation in a high-level manner.

There is currently no interface for defining callbacks. This will be rectified
very soon. The module as it stands is still useful for stripping out telnet
escape sequences.

This module is likely missing large parts of the telnet spec. Please let me
know if you need particular things implemented. Failing test cases are the
best bug reports!

=head1 NEGOTIATION

Negotiation in L<IO::Socket::Telnet> is achieved in two ways. By responding to
callbacks and by initiating it yourself.

=head2 PASSIVE NEGOTATION

There are two types of callback: one for the simple IAC <DO|DONT|WILL|WONT> <option> negotiation, and the other for the more complicated IAC SB <stuff> IAC SE.

=head3 SIMPLE CALLBACK

You can define a simple callback by using

    $socket->telnet_simple_callback(\&your_callback);

The callback receives two arguments: the socket itself and a human-readable
version of the option that is being negotiated. For example, if the server
sends "IAC DO ECHO", then the second option will be "DO ECHO". This aims to
facilitate the use of regular expressions on the options. If the telnet library
doesn't know the name of the particular option being negotiated, it will return
its character number instead. Only the first 50 or so characters are assigned
meaning in the telnet spec, so if the server sends "IAC WILL chr(63)" then your
callback will receive "WILL 63" as its argument.

The callback can return a few different values:

=over 4

=item One of: "DO", "DONT", "WILL", "WONT"

These will be interpreted as responding to the other server. They will be
packaged into the regular telnet escape codes for you.

=item 0 or 1

These correspond with "DO", "DONT", "WILL", and "WONT" in the obvious way. Zero
will return the negation of the input (so WILL generates DONT, WONT generates
DO, etc). One returns the affirmative of the input (so WILL generates DO, WONT
generates DONT, etc).

=item C<undef>

A return value of C<undef> will be interpreted by C<IO::Socket::Telnet> as "do
the best you can". Generally this is equivalent to returning "DONT" or "WONT"
to everything but it may change in the future. This is also the default when no
callback it set.

=item The empty string

The empty string will be interpreted as "do not respond to this negotiation."
(Yes, all three canonical false values have different meanings!)

=item Anything else

Any other return value is sent straight across the socket. This assumes you
know what you're doing. Perhaps working around the limitations/ignorance of
this module? :)

=back

=head3 COMPLEX CALLBACK

The complex callback is not specced yet. Right now you receive the raw
subnegotiation buffer (if this means nothing to you, then run. RUN!) but there
are plans to prettify this input when able. For example, NAWS (negotiate about
window size) will probably just hand you the dimensions ($X, $Y) instead of
chr($X).chr(0).chr($Y).chr(0).

=head2 ACTIVE NEGOTIATION

The four basic option types (DO, DONT, WILL, WONT) each have individual methods
(both lowercase and uppercase form). They each take one argument: either the
name of the option ('ECHO'), or the character code of the option (chr(1) for
ECHO).

There is currently no "easy" way to send complex negotiation. This will be
rectified soon. At the very least I want a method that lets you wrap an
arbitrary subnegotiation and have it be escaped and packaged correctly.

=head1 CAVEATS

You must use the C<< $socket->recv(...) >> method call form.
C<recv($socket, ...)> will not invoke the necessary methods. You can use
C<print $socket ...> because C<print> currently has no special semantics.

This library does not yet attempt to "remember" negotiations. This means that
if you connect with some other client that has the same limitation, you'll
likely negotiate infinitely. Thankfully most people aren't terrible like I
am. This limitation (endless negotiation, not people being good) will be
fixed soon. Honest!

=head1 SIMILAR MODULES

L<Net::Telnet> has a similar purpose, to interact via telnet with someone else.
The major difference is that L<Net::Telnet> tries to be L<Expect> to some
degree as well. This is fine if that's what you need to do, but the author of
L<IO::Socket::Telnet> wants to play NetHack on a remote server, and
L<Net::Telnet> doesn't help him very much. I think I have a better negotiation
interface as well. :)
