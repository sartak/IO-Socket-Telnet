IO-Socket-Telnet 0.01

Telnet is a simple protocol that sits on top of TCP/IP. It handles the
negotiation of various options, both about the connection itself (ECHO)
and the setup of both sides of the party (NAWS, TTYPE).

This is a wrapper around IO::Socket::INET that both strips out the telnet
escape sequences and lets you handle the negotiation in a high-level manner.

The interface for defining callbacks is subject to change. It needs to be
less manual.
